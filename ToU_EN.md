- Please refer to the different license files contained within the designated folder before usage.
- Please credit me (Lotte V) when using any of my voicebanks.
- Do __<ins>NOT</ins>__ reupload the original voicebank elsewhere; please refer to the original download link instead.
    - However, custom dictionaries and the like are free to be redistributed even without prior permission. Please credit me if you do so.
- You're allowed to use the voice and/or character in both commercial and noncommercial projects, whether covers or original works, without prior permission.
- You're allowed to use the voicebank's auto-pitch feature in works using a different voicebank. All I ask is that you credit me for the pitch model.

- Derivative characters are allowed without prior permission, as long as the character art isn't being edited for this purpose (see above).
    - Please make sure that derivative characters are created through settings contained within the synthesis software itself, rather than through pitch-shifting fully mixed songs through audio software (e.g. "pitchloids" are not allowed).
